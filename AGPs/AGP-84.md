# AGP-84: Adding a Flock track to AGP-1

## File changed (AGP-0 or AGP-1)

AGP-1

## Link to proposed change

https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/pull/83

## Motivation for making this change

The Flock application process and the AGP process are currently separate which can create a confusing flow for applicants, AGP Editors, and the Aragon Association.

The changes proposed in this PR aim at improving applicant UX by merging the Flock process into AGP-1 and creating a Flock Track.

Further implications if approved:
- AGP-1 will become the only source of information for all proposal types. 
- The current [Flock repo](https://github.com/aragon/flock) will be deprecated and any key information about the Flock program (guides, templates, current teams...) will be moved a Flock section of the Aragon Wiki.
