### Summary

We propose to continue our work securing the Aragon Network, on a retainer basis for a 1 year period, working with the entities responsible for developing AragonOS, Aragon Apps, and other code of interest.


## Address of the transfer recipient

0xF0001193a7919B14417c038604846D7b3F8F4BC3

## Amount of the transfer

140,000 DAI


## Number and frequency of transfers if recurring (enter “1” if only one payment will be made)

4 transfers of the amount above, payable every 3 months starting after ANV-02 has completed.

## Purpose of the transfer

Retainer for security services for a 1 year period.

### Description of Services

In each 3 month period, we will allocate 4 weeks of 2 people "actively auditing", which may include smart contract auditing, penetration testing, application security review, or other intensive security review related work. We respectfully request a 2 week notice in advance of initiating an active audit phase.

We anticipate continuing to work primarily with the Aragon One team, but also may be redirected by the AA to work with any team making major improvements to the system.

If not utilized in a given 3 month period, that time can accumulate for another 3 month period. If A1 requires more time, we will charge the prorated fee in subsequent voting periods, or through the proposed [ANSP Engagement Policy](https://forum.aragon.org/t/draft-agp-for-anv-02-ansp-engagement-policy/750).


### Our commitment

The time allocation and advanced notice outlined above are not designed to add friction, or bureaucracy to our work with A1. it Between audit periods, we will continue support, advice and engage with the Aragon One team. We understand that time estimation is difficult in software development, and we encourage caution over meeting arbitrary deadlines. 

If a start date needs to be postponed, or something else needs to shift, we will make our best effort to accomodate. We currently have two excellent auditors working on Aragon. Under this retainer arrangement we will train up more excellent people on the Aragon codebase to make that kind of responsiveness possible.

We will also actively seek opportunities to enrich security knowledge and discussion across the entire Aragon Flock and community, and look forward to opportunities to work with other Flock groups.
