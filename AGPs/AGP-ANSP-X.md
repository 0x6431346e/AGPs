### Summary

We propose to continue working with the Aragon One team on a retainer basis for a 1 year period. 

## Address of the transfer recipient

0xF0001193a7919B14417c038604846D7b3F8F4BC3

## Amount of the transfer

140,000 DAI
20,000 ANT


## Number and frequency of transfers if recurring (enter “1” if only one payment will be made)

4 transfers, payable every 3 months starting after ANV-02 has completed.

## Purpose of the transfer

Retainer for security services for a 1 year period.

### Description of Services

In each 3 month period, we will allocate 4 weeks of 2 people "actively auditing", which may include smart contract auditing, penetration testing, application security review, or other intensive security review related work to the Aragon One team. We respectfully request a 2 week notice in advance of initiating an active audit phase.

If A1 does not need the full 4 week audit time allocation, we can allocate to auditing other Aragon Network projects. If A1 requires more time, we will charge the prorated fee in subsequent voting periods, or through the proposed [ANSP Engagement Policy](https://forum.aragon.org/t/draft-agp-for-anv-02-ansp-engagement-policy/750).


### Our commitment

The time allocation and advanced notice outlined above are not designed to add friction, or bureaucracy to our work with A1. it Between audit periods, we will continue support, advice and engage with the Aragon One team. We understand that time estimation is difficult in software development, and we encourage caution over meeting arbitrary deadlines. 

If a start date needs to be postponed, or something else needs to shift, we will make our best effort to accomodate. We currently have two excellent auditors working on Aragon. Under this retainer arrangement we will train up more excellent people on the Aragon codebase to make that kind of responsiveness possible.
