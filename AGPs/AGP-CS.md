## Purpose of the transfer

At the moment, Aragon fully depends on Ethereum mainnet in order to function.

However, Ethereum may not be the best platform for all Aragon use cases. Some Aragon organizations may not want to pay the security and composability premium for being on Ethereum.

On top of this, we are seeing increased development and user experience costs [resulting from changes in the Ethereum protocol that break Aragon organizations](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-istanbul-upgrade-will-break-680-smart-contracts-on-aragon).

Building a sovereign layer 1 protocol owned and operated by the Aragon community will ensure that we can continue enhancing Aragon, and even introduce protocol changes that make running decentralized organizations easier and cheaper. This way we can offer Aragon organizations another option parallel to Ethereum, with different security, cost, and performance trade-offs. The idea is for this chain to be heavily focused and optimized for the Aragon use case, so other heavyweight use cases that are currently clogging the Ethereum network wouldn't necessarily have any incentives to run on the Aragon Chain.

The Aragon Chain will be an EVM compatible Proof of Stake blockchain whose native staking token is derived from ANT (in a similar fashion as the Aragon Court's ANJ).

Aragon One has worked with ChainSafe Systems on a feasibility study on what the most fitting technology for building the Aragon Chain is. We are now certain of the way forward and it's ready to get into the specification and development phase.

Feasibility report: TBD (to be made public ahead of the AGP phase V transition)

The report goes indepth between the current leading staking chains: Polkadot and Cosmos. Throughout the report comparisons are made based on Aragon specific optimizations, and cross-chain communication.

Deliverables from this project:

- Publish Aragon Chain spec
- Develop full-node software that follows the Aragon Chain spec
- Launch Aragon Chain testnet
- Launch Aragon Chain mainnet
