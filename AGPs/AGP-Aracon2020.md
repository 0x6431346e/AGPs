# AraCon 2020

## Dates
We are aiming for the month of June 2020 

## Location
While Berlin is a great spot in terms of community, availability of venues, connections and prices, Aragon is a completely distributed organization and community, so we think it's only fitting that we organize the conference in a different place each year.

We have asked feedback to the community, and it doesn't seem that we would be able to attract a lot of people to places like South or Central America. With the current situation in the USA, and our limited reach in Asia at this point, Europe seems like the best place for it.

At this time, the #1 choice would be **Lisbon**, while keeping the "easier" option of replicating Berlin in case we are not able to find something that could have the level of execution we had this year.

Lisbon is interesting because of its ease of access and logistics, its growing scene, the availability of venues, and still reasonable prices.
Conflicting conferences are also a major factor, and we are in touch with the organizers of EthLisbon and the Lisbon Blockchain Week, which would happen at around the same time. It seems like a good idea to combine the efforts.

This is still not set in stone, and we could reconsider to somewhere else if there was some particularly good reason to.

## Agenda
We are planning on switching a bit the format. 2019 was a 2 day event, and while it was awesome, it is a big commitment from people that are not 100% focused on Aragon. Therefore, the plan would be to switch to a 1+1 event agenda. One main day of conference, and a smaller second day event to be filled with community meetings, workshops, demos, and similar content.
This should help reduce the costs associated with the venue and the food.

## Organizers
We have been lucky to be able to re-confirm the 2019 organizer, Lucija Matic, who would be ready to take care of the full organization of the conference, with help from other community members.

## Budget 
We have also budgeted what it would cost, based on the costs we had this year and the proposed changes in the Agenda.

|Topic|€|Notes|

|Venue|€40,000.00| This is a complete estimate, as we have yet to define where
|AV|€70,000.00|This is on the high side, but we have been very happy with the service, and doubt we could get anything similar for much lower a price 
|Food|€90,000.00|People eat a lot, but we might be able to get lower than this|
|Furniture rental|€10,000.00|
|Entertainment|€3,000.00|
|Event Documentation|€20,000.00|
|Marketing|€5,000.00|
|Decoration|€5,000.00|
|Guest services|€10,000.00|
|Organizers|€50,000.00|Estimate, the AA can subsidize some part of this from its budget.
