## Proclamation text

The Aragon Network declares its national holiday on February 8th, called *Fight for freedom Day*.

## Motivation for writing this proclamation

The Aragon Network doesn't care about traditional nations and their local holidays. Yet, as a soon-to-be jurisdiction, having a holiday seems like a great way to set a date for the community to get together and celebrate.

There are multiple dates that are relevant for the project. For example:

- Nov 11th, 2016: The first idea for Aragon was born and Luis wrote the first whitepaper
- Feb 8th, 2017: Luis and Jorge release Aragon to the world
- May 17th, 2017: The Aragon Network token sale happened
- Nov 15th, 2018: AGP-1 was ratified by ANT holders



Out of those, I propose Feb 8th for the following reasons:

- Releasing Aragon to the world was quite an achievement. There are lots of people with ideas, but not so many who can execute on them. On Feb 8th, anyone could create a decentralized organization with a few clicks. It was the beginning of a new era
- It's the nearest date to the beginning of the year, which probably gathers more attention since usually there aren't a lot of local festivities during the first months of the year

- It happens on Fri during 2019, Sat during 2020, Sun during 2021 and Mon during 2022
