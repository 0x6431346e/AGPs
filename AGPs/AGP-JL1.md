## Instructions

To make a Meta track change, you must:

1. Create a pull request changing either AGP-0 or AGP-1.
2. In a _separate_ pull request, create a new file in the AGPs folder of the AGPs repo.
3. Add a link to the pull request created in step 1 to the link section below.
4. Submit the new file as a pull request to the AGPs repo. This will be the AGP pull request. If the AGP is approved by ANT holders, the pull request created in step 1 will be merged. If the proposal is rejected and withdrawn, the pull request created in step 1 will be closed.

## File changed (AGP-0 or AGP-1)

AGP-1

## Link to proposed change

## Motivation for making this change

Through the process of planning for the first AGP vote under AGP-1, I noticed some ways that voting logistics could be improved. This AGP implements those improvements.
