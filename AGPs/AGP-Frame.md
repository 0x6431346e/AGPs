# AGP-Frame: Flock Funding for Frame
## Address of the Transfer Recipient
We request funds to be sent to our Aragon DAO: [`frame.aragonid.eth`](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/frame.aragonid.eth) 0xe30b0d5168dfd8d92bc511e814de14e3757c775e

## Amount of Transfer
284,000 DAI

50,000 ANT per year for the next 4 years with a 1 year cliff

## Number of Transfers
1

## Purpose of Transfer
Frame joining Flock allows us to **continue development and support of Aragon-related initiatives**. We will continue **adding fundamental value to the Aragon ecosystem at the platform layer**. We'd like to embark on **deeper coordination within Aragon to provide support for any platform Aragon chooses to build on: Aragon Chain, Ethereum, IPFS, desktop, mobile, etc.** We’re looking forward to working with current and future Flock/Nest teams to fulfill their needs at this layer and to create a unified effort towards wider adoption. **We’ve made it our mission to keep our proposal focused and will over-deliver on our initiatives. We think our vision for adding value to Aragon is compelling and thoughtful. We hope others see the impact we'll have if included in Flock.**

Frame being included in Flock gives Aragon the ability to create, iterate, improve, and maintain a path for users to go from zero knowledge, to participating in a DAO. **This will be a very important feature for bigger teams, communities, and organizations that want to start using Aragon. Large groups will be able to send out a simple link to all members, allowing everyone to seamlessly get up and running using their DAO without any external support.**

 We think Aragon is a **fundamentally more efficient substrate to organize human effort**. As a team driven by the **acceleration of human innovation**, we’ll always support Aragon here. We believe **making the Aragon vision a reality will lead to massive jumps in the quality of life for all humans**.

To cover our operation costs, Frame requests:
* 284,000 DAI to cover 26 weeks of operating costs for 5 full-time employees and contractors
* 50,000 ANT per year for the next 4 years as an alignment package (with a 1 year cliff)
