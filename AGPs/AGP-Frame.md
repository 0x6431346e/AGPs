# AGP-Frame: Flock Funding for Frame
## Address of the Transfer Recipient
We request funds to be sent to our Aragon DAO: [`frame.aragonid.eth`](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/frame.aragonid.eth)

## Amount of Transfer
358,000 DAI

## Number of Transfers
1

## Purpose of Transfer
Frame joining Flock allows us to **continue development and support of Aragon related initiatives**. We will continue **adding fundamental value to the Aragon ecosystem at the platform layer**. We'd like to embark on **deeper coordination within Aragon to provide support for any platform Aragon chooses to build on: desktop, mobile, Ethereum, Polkadot, IPFS, etc.** We’re looking forward to working with current and future Flock/Nest teams to fulfill their needs at this layer and to **create a unified effort towards wider adoption**.

**Frame being included in Flock gives Aragon the ability to create, iterate, improve and maintain a path for users to go from zero knowledge, to participating in a DAO. We think this is an important step.**

 We think Aragon is a **fundamentally more efficient substrate to organize human effort**. As a team driven by the **acceleration of human innovation**, we’ll always support Aragon here. We believe **making the Aragon vision a reality will lead to massive jumps in the quality of life for all humans**.

To cover our operation costs, Frame requests:
* 358,000 DAI to cover 26 weeks of operating costs for 5 full-time employees and contractors
* 80,000 ANT as alignment package vested over 4 years
