# ANV Reward Policy

## Description of desired Association policy change

The Aragon Association would adopt a policy of distributing ANT rewards to voters based on their participation in Aragon Network Votes. This AGP would approve the allocation of no more than 1 Million USD in ANT over the next 12 Months. Rewards would be distributed to active voters proportional to their stake. If AGP voting app is updated to allow for delegation, the rewards should be split between the delegate and the principal voter.

## Motivation for changing this Association policy

This policy is intended to address several concurrent challenges.

1) Make it more difficult to influence vote results by buying ANT, voting, and immediately selling due to a higher ratio between between available liquidity and voter participation rate.
2) Shift the distribution of ANT from relatively inactive speculators to active network participants.
3) Provide a data point as to how sensitive voters are to financial incentives and inform potential future implementations of participation rate targeting mechanisms.
