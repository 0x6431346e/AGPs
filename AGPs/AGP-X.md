# Adding a Flock track to AGP-1

## File changed (AGP-0 or AGP-1)

AGP-1

## Link to proposed change

https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/pull/83

## Motivation for making this change

The Flock application process and the AGP process are currently separate which can create a confusing flow for applicants, AGP editors and the Aragon Association.

This proposal aims at making the applicant UX better first and foremost, by adding a Flock track to AGP-1. Thanks to this change, AGP-1 will become a single source of information about all propositions made to the network.

If this AGP is approved, the Flock repo will be deprecated and all additional information about the Flock program (guides, templates, current teams) will be moved a Flock section of the Aragon Wiki.
