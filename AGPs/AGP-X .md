# "AGP-X: Decentralize Nest"

## Description of desired Association policy change

The Aragon Association is proposing the implementation of a Nest DAO governed by community members. This DAO will be in charge of selecting Nest grantees. We consider it a first step to decentralize Nest and make it an autonomous grant program.

Through this AGP, the Aragon Association is seeking approval from the community to take the necessary steps to fulfill this vision.

## Motivation for changing this Association policy

Up until now, the Aragon Association has been in charge of running the Nest program. This has included:
1. Maintaining the Nest GitHub repository
2. Coordinating discussions around Nest proposals among network participants
3. Selecting Nest teams and respectively allocating grants
4. Following up on grantees, monitoring their deliverables, and ensuring coordination between grantees and the rest of the network

The Aragon Association is proposing to put the Nest DAO in charge of  "3. Selecting Nest teams and respectively allocating grants" and to update the grant allocation process accordingly. The most recent specification for the new Nest grant allocation reflecting this new proposed process can be found here: https://forum.aragon.org/t/agp-proposal-for-a-new-nest-grant-allocation-process/998.

In order to address potential unexpected issues that could arise during the review and implementation of the specification given above, the Aragon Association wishes to keep the discretion to decide on potential changes made to it.
