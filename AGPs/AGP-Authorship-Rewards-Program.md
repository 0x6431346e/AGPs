# AGP-X: AGP Authorship Rewards Program

## Address of the transfer recipient
AGP authors and contributors will list addresses on future AGPs.

## Amount of the transfer
300 ANT to the author of an AGP that is approved by the AA for an upcoming ANV.

200 ANT to any listed contributors of an AGP that is approved by the AA for an upcoming ANV.

300 ANT to the author of an AGP that is approved by ANT voters.

200 ANT to any listed contributors of an AGP that is approved by ANT voters.

## Number and frequency of transfers if recurring (enter “1” if only one payment will be made)
1.

## Purpose of the transfer
Aragon is a decentralized governance platform. AGPs are the foundation of the governance process. Engaging in governance is hard. It takes lots of time, emotional energy, and time. There is currently no motivation to engage in AGP discussions or author AGPs other than altruism or personal interest. This greatly reduces the time and effort spent on AGPs.

To address this we need to reward AGP authors. They are doing the Aragon community a service by engaging in discussions, packing ideas into AGPs, receiving community feedback, modifying AGPs, and pushing them through the various stages of the ANV process. AGPs are one of the most important aspects of the Aragon community.

The following rewards seem like a healthy incentive to get more people's attention focused on AGPs, both in authorship and diligence:
- 300 ANT to the author of an AGP that is approved by the AA for an upcoming ANV
- 200 ANT to contributors of an AGP that is approved by the AA for an upcoming ANV
- 300 ANT to the author of an AGP that is approved by ANT voters
- 200 ANT to contributors of an AGP that is approved by ANT voters

 Passing the community review and Aragon Association review periods disqualifies any completely spammy proposals. If a proposal makes it through both review periods it could be assumed that it is adding some value to the community. Passing in an Aragon Network Vote shows that ANT holders appreciate the proposal and want the value it creates. AGP authors and contributors do a lot of work to provide this value and they should be rewarded accordingly.

If AGP authors do not list contributors in an AGP, then the contributor rewards will simply not be paid out. The AGP author will not be paid more.

If an AGP author lists contributors, rewards will be split equally between all contributors equally. While this does not account for the fact that some contributors will have done more work than others, it keeps things simple and is a major step forward from the current situation.

If a community member has contributed a lot they can be listed as a co-author and the authorship reward can be split between co-authors. Overall, this AGP aims to encourage collaboration by rewarding and recognizing community members who contribute to AGP conversations.

In order to receive authorship or contributor rewards authors and/or contributors must add an Ethereum address to the AGP where they wish to receive authorship or contributor rewards.

The Aragon Association will pay out AGP authorship and contributor rewards at the end of every ANV cycle after ANT votes have been finalized and announced.
